# Fixed-Income-Yield-Solver
Quick tool for testing convergence of various root solving methods

Primary purpose of this tool was logging critical points where convergence fails when tested against several price ranges and accordingly redesigning of convergence parameters of a software module.

Following methods are included:

-Newton Raphson method

-Bisection method
